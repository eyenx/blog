## welcome

This is me trying really hard to blog about something. I know the fact, that trying really hard to accomplish something, might not be the best idea.

But well, here I am, yet another time with a new design. Perhaps I should tell you how I made this.

## jekyll Bootstrap and Flex Theme

I used [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) and the [Flex theme](http://jeffreymartin.ca/flex/) with some modifications to create this blogging homepage. In the near future, I will create a new repository on [github](https://github.com/eyenx) for the code, but for now, let's stick with scp.

## what I am in need to do next 

There are still some modifications that need to be done.

- I want to create an **about** page
- share the code on **github**
- **automatically deploy** this static site on my [DigitalOcean](http://digitalocean.com) vhost
- **post comments** over [Disqus](http://disqus.com)

I hope to be writing again soon.
