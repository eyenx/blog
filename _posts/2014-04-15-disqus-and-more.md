## Finally an update!

I managed to find some time to actually set up [disqus](http://disqus.com) on this blog.

It wasn't very difficult, just create a new account and pick the javascript snippet they are providing.

There is now also an about page over [here](http://eyenx.ch/about.html). Please don't make fun of my picture :-) 

The interesting thing though, are these nice mono icons:

{% include image.html url="symbols.png"  style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" description="symbols" %}

It won't take you long to find out it's actually only an icon font. In fact after looking for some nice icons for a very long time (about 5 min) on [deviantart](http://www.deviantart.com), I happened to come across this open source project started by [Ivan Drinchev](http://www.drinchev.com).

You can find all relevant information on [this homepage](http://http://drinchev.github.io/monosocialiconsfont/). It is fairly easy to set up. Have fun!
