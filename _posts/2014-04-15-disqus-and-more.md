## finally an update!

I managed to find some time to actually set up [disqus](http://disqus.com) on this blog.

It wasn't very difficult, just create a new account and pick the javascript snippet they are providing.

There is now also an about page over [here](http://eyenx.ch/about.html). Please don't make fun of my picture :-) 

The interesting thing though, are these nice mono icons:

It won't take you long to find out it's actually only an icon font. In fact after looking for some nice icons for a very long time (about 5 min) on [deviantart](http://www.deviantart.com), I happened to come across this open source project started by [Ivan Drinchev](http://www.drinchev.com).

You can find all relevant information on [this homepage](http://drinchev.github.io/monosocialiconsfont/). It is fairly easy to set up. Have fun!

## edit

I [changed](https://github.com/eyenx/eyenx.ch/commit/3ebf62c21e4bc55d4ebc8fc110bf4c247a5377f5) from the mono social icon font to Foundation Icons. You can find all relevant Info [here](http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3).
