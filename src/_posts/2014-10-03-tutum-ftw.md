## I'm using tutum.co now

Visit it now if you don't know about this yet: [tutum.co](http://tutum.co)

### docker.io

The whole [Docker](http://docker.io) thing caught my eye very fast. I started messing around with [dockerfiles](http://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/), building my custom images, running some containers, just for fun.

After some time I heard [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/company/blog/coreos-now-available-on-digitalocean/) was making the [CoreOS](http://coreos.com) image available for their droplets.

I also started messing around with CoreOS. It is very simple to set up, given the good tutorial available on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-coreos-cluster-on-digitalocean).

But it wasn't something I could migrate to in minutes. I needed more time to make the service stable.

### Tutum comes up with a new service

Last week I received an email from Tutum announcing their new service available at [http://dashboard.tutum.co](http://dashboard.tutum.co). Their objective was to stop doing actual hosting and concentrate on the management of docker containers.

They also announced their native support with DigitalOcean. I was looking forward to try it out.

## node clusters and service clusters

The idea of Tutum is to serve as a managing application for deployment of entire container clusters. They also give you a private docker repository for free, which is nice.

After connecting my Tutum account with the DigitalOcean one, I deployed my first node cluster.

The next step was to deploy a service.

### dockerfile

I looked a long time at some already built jekyll dockerfiles, but none of them seemed to match my expectations.

For some days or weeks I was idling. So I decided to just use my own dockerfile for my blog. As starting image I tried using [base/archlinux](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/base/archlinux/).


{% highlight bash %}
λ ~/dev/docker/eyenx.ch ls -1
Dockerfile
nginx.conf
start
λ ~/dev/docker/eyenx.ch cat start Dockerfile
su - http -c "git pull ; jekyll build" -s /bin/bash ; nginx
FROM base/archlinux
MAINTAINER eye@eyenx.ch

RUN pacman -Syyu --noconfirm
RUN pacman -S --noconfirm ruby nginx git python2 base-devel
RUN rm -rf /var/cache/pacman/pkg/*

RUN gem install --install-dir /usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.1.0 --no-user-install \
  jekyll \
  kramdown \
  therubyracer


RUN chown http.http -R /srv/http
RUN su - http -c "git clone http://github.com/eyenx/eyenx.ch . ; \
jekyll build" -s /bin/bash

COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
COPY start /start
RUN chmod +x /start

CMD /start

EXPOSE 80
{% endhighlight %}
\\
The nginx.conf shouldn't be such a hassle for you.

### build it! push it! deploy it!

After building the image, trying it out and [pushing it to the private repository](http://support.tutum.co/support/solutions/articles/5000012183-private) of tutum.co, I could finally deploy my first service.

To try some stuff out, I even deployed it loadbalanced. And it is really easy to accomplish.

- deploy custom docker image, exposing dynamic ports on the node (leaving everything as it is)
- launch new service
- chose tutum/haproxy as image
- expose port 80 on the node
- full access API Role & Link to custom service
- done

Also, this [tutorial](http://support.tutum.co/support/solutions/articles/5000050235-load-balancing-a-web) helped a lot.

## I'm still on boring VPS for now

Probably you aren't reading this content from a deployed container right now. I haven't switched yet.

I'm still trying everything out and also waiting for Tutum to make some more steps. At the moment, the Tutum-deployed service is available at [http://dev.eyenx.ch](http://dev.eyenx.ch).
