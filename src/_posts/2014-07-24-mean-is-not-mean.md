## MEAN - LAMP for hipsters

Not quite. What means MEAN anyway? Everyone should know what LAMP means if you were not born yesterday.

- **L**inux
- **A**pache
- **M**ySQL (MariaD)
- **P**HP

**MEAN** is the modern, hipster cousin of LAMP.

- **M**ongoDB
- **E**xpressJS
- **A**ngularJS
- **N**odeJS

That's a lot of **JS**. As I said. Made by hipsters, for hipsters, just kidding.

## how does it work?

I came across this idea on a tutorial I read on [scotch.io](http://scotch.io/bar-talk/setting-up-a-mean-stack-single-page-application). Really simple:

* MongoDB is our NoSQL DB in the background
* NodeJS will work with ExpressJS to serve a easy built API for our frontend.
* AngularJS will be our frontend and get the data from our API an do the rest (views etc.)

Thanks to this you can develop and let your **API** grow without having to touch the frontend app itself.

I took the liberty to link this image I found on scotch.io for better understanding:

![mean](/img/p/20140724_1.jpg){: .center}

You could also try to get a better idea from [mean.io](http://mean.io) or [meanjs.org](http://meanjs.org).

## try it out

I tried the [single app page todo app](http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular) from **scotch.io** and it was really fun and easy! But I encourage everyone to learn you some [angularjs](http://angularjs.org) first. It is very useful when you will be starting to read about angular modules and scopes and I still have a lot to learn about angular too.

## last words

**MEAN** may be something new  at first, but it is **not** mean at all. I learned a lot in only a few hours and it wasn't difficult at all!
