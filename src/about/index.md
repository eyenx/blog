My name is **Antonio Tauro**, but everyone calls me **Toni**.

On the interwebs I may hide behind the nicknames **eyenx**,**eye** or my old alias **gnomeye**.
I consider myself a geek, coder, **GNU/Linux** and **opensource** enthusiast.
At the moment I'm working as an IT System Specialist in an Unix/Linux oriented service application team.
In my spare time I find myself enjoying food, wine, **going for a run** or travelling around mainly in Europe.

I'm currently living near **Berne, Switzerland**.
